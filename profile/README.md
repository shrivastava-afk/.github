# Welcome to shrivastava-afk

> **Building cloud-native solutions & learning.**

## About This Organization

This organization houses my personal projects, experiments, and contributions in the DevOps and cloud infrastructure space. While my day job focuses on enterprise-scale Kubernetes, this is my sandbox for testing bleeding-edge tools, building operators, and exploring **AI-driven infrastructure**.

## Focus Areas

- **Kubernetes & Cloud Native**: Custom Operators, Controllers, and CRDs.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Terraform, Helm charts, and GitOps workflows.
- **AI & MCP Agents**: Implementing **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to create agents that can debug, and optimize real-world infrastructure.
- **DevOps Tooling**: CLI tools, ChatOps, and monitoring solutions.

## Featured Projects

### [Gandalf Operator](https://github.com/shrivastava-afk/gandalf)
*“You shall not pass... without credentials!”*
A Kubernetes operator that enforces security by automatically injecting Nginx sidecars for Basic Authentication. It monitors specific annotations on Deployments and StatefulSets to ensure no internal service is left exposed.
